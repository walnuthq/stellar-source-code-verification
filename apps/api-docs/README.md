# api-docs

Static OpenAPI documentation for the Stellar Source Code Verification
`api-registry` service, hosted on GitHub Pages.

It uses [`swagger-jsdoc`](https://github.com/Surnet/swagger-jsdoc) to build an
OpenAPI 3.1 spec from the `@openapi` JSDoc blocks written next to the route
handlers in `api-registry`, then bundles it with the
[`swagger-ui-dist`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-ui-dist) assets into a
fully static site (`dist/`). There is **no server at runtime** — the spec is
generated at build time and served as a plain `openapi.json` file.

## Sources

The spec is generated from JSDoc comments in:

- `apps/api-registry/src/**` — the Contract Verification Registry API

To document an endpoint, add an `@openapi` JSDoc block above its handler in
`api-registry`. The next build picks it up automatically — no changes needed
here.

## Build & preview

```bash
# Generate the static site into dist/
pnpm --filter api-docs build

# Build, then serve dist/ locally at http://localhost:8082
pnpm --filter api-docs dev

# Serve an already-built dist/ without rebuilding
pnpm --filter api-docs preview
```

The build emits, into `dist/`:

- the vendored Swagger UI assets (`index.html`, CSS, JS)
- `openapi.json` — the generated spec
- `swagger-initializer.js` — points Swagger UI at `./openapi.json`

> The spec is generated from TypeScript **source** files, so always build from a
> checkout of the monorepo.

## Deployment

Pushes to `main` that touch `apps/api-docs/**` or `apps/api-registry/src/**`
trigger the `Deploy api-docs` GitHub Actions workflow
(`.github/workflows/deploy-api-docs.yml`), which builds `dist/` and publishes it
to GitHub Pages. Enable Pages for the repo with **Source: GitHub Actions**.

## Configuration

`API_REGISTRY_URL` populates the `servers` list shown in Swagger UI so requests
can be tried against a running instance (see `.env.example`). In CI it is read
from the `API_REGISTRY_URL` repository variable; if unset it defaults to
`http://localhost:8081`.
